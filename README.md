# NetnaijaCrawler
Crawls netnaija for movies and metadata

The aim of this project is to develop a mobile application which solves the problem of downloading movies.

# Features
- Movie info : Users can view information about a movie and probably search and filter out based on age or category
- Download movie : This is the most important part, Users should be able to download a movie they find in the app, this project is the main crawler that scrapes movies from the netnaija website. Movies can be stored on telegram.

Movie info can be gotten from tmdb and the movie files can be scraped from various sources such as fzmovies, netnaija and so on.

The current problem with this script is the botprotection/ads netnaija has built on their system. It acts as a bot protection since it seems to be tracking the cursor position of the device hence knowing when a real user is interacting with the frontend. Using browsers like tor, you may be able to bypass the ads and probably the bot protection thing.
